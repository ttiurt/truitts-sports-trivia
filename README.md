LINK TO A LOVELY QUIZ GAME: https://truitts-trivia.netlify.app/

INFO AND RULES:

Upon going to the link provided you will be greeted with a home page at which you will chose which category you would like to test your knowledge. Once you have selected your category you'll be sent to the quiz. When the first question appears a 20 second timer will start counting down for you to answer that question. For each correct answer you will be given 20 points or 0 points if you fail to answer or chose the incorrect answer. After answering all 5 questions you will be shown your final score as well as the options to restart your current category or change to another category.

TECHNOLOGIES USED:

Each category was made with their own JavaScript and HTML files while sharing the same CSS file

RESOURCES:

Most questions I thought of then I used Google to find the answer, the questions that weren't thought of by me stemmed from stats or facts on https://www.wikipedia.org/ pertaining to the category I was researching.
